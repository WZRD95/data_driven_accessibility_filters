> How does changing an image filter compare to a more data driven approach to help see colors?

There are many ways to use filters to help in assisting people that have CVD. However there seem to not be many in the idea of data driven filtering. This way there can possibly be a way to make sure that the colors they are looking at are the same or not. Since now there is hard data to isolate the colors or to show numereacal data in what colors are there. Overall this can show that maybe with a more data driven approach we can now be more certain that the colors you do see are indeed the same or different.
