> How does changing an image filter compare to a more data driven approach to help see colors?

Current color-filtering methods for people with color vision deficiency (CVD) have limits because they often rely on assumptions rather than on objective data. By taking a data-driven approach, we can analyze colors with greater certainty. Using image data to analyze colors, rather than relying on simple filters, provides a more precise way to find color matches. This approach could help those with CVD be more confident that the colors they see are the same as those seen by someone with normal vision.
